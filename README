This required PHP with CLI-Support! 
See http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.php

Edit the file ./inc/config.php. Should be self explaining.

4. Modules
----------

Put the modules you want to have startet with ircmasher in the

5. Commands

NOTE: We suggest to query the bot for admin work - but it works 
into the chan likewise fine. 
 
// mute/unmute the masher...
mute $botpasswd $channel               (mute the bot)
unmute $botpasswd $channel             (unmute the bot)

// the admin commands
giveop $botpw $channel $nick           (give chan-op status)
takeop $botpw $channel $nick           (take chan-op status)
give voice                             (voice a user)
dvoice $botpw $channel $nick           (de-voice a user)
kick $botpw $channel $nick             (kick a user from chan)
say $botpw $your_message_txt           (let the IRCmasher talk :P)
go to bed $nick $botpw                 (diconnect)

// the user commands...
!time                                  (the time...)
